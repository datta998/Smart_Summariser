For the next several days, he did not lose his temper, and so did not hammer any nail. Every time he lost his temper, he ran to the fence and hammered a nail. After the next few days, the number of nails hammered on the fence was reduced to half. The little boy found it very difficult to hammer the nails and decided to control his temper.
 In a small village, a little boy lived with his father and mother.
