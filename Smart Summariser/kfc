
Summary:she said,
‘The little blighters are in bed,
Then snatch the greasy, stinky tots,
 On a farm in West Kentucky,
Lived a smart and rather plucky,
Gigantic, speckled farmyard hen,
 And locals, there, would often say,
‘This hen is ludicrously smart,
Her IQ score is off the chart.’

 I will devise a cunning plan,
To dodge that wretched frying pan,
And seek revenge on little chops,
 And other slimey, greasy junk,
Then processed, paper-wrapped and sold,
 Apply my secret crispy layer,
And serve them in a bucket to,
My ever faithful farmyard crew.

 Then when,’ she cried, ‘they are the meal,
They’ll understand just how we feel!
