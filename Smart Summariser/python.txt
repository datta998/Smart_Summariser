
Summary:It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.

 Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[28]

 Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x[33] and later are supported.
 Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[29]

Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language.
